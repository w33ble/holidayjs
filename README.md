# Smiling Ornaments

# What?

This is a WebRTC app that takes an image of the user and overlays it on an image of a tree to act as an ornament. The image is also put on the tree of any other connected users via Websockets.

You can play with the [live example online](http://holidayjs.herokuapp.com/).
